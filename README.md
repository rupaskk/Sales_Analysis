# Sales Analysis With SQL
Repository containing a T-SQL script file with a Sales data analysis from the [AdventureWorks sample data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms). Microsoft offers the AdventureWorks data set to provide a sample database, data warehouse, and OLAP cube.

## Project Objective 📑
This Sales data analysis was completed for self-learning purpose and to practice my skills with T-SQL queries. I have also restored the AdventureWorks data warehouse into SQL server 2022 using the graphical interface (GUI) in SQL Server Management Studio.
